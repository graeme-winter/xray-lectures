# Elements of X-ray Diffraction

X-ray diffraction is the phenomenon resulting from scattering of photons by atoms where the positions of the atoms has translational symmetry. The correlation of atomic positions gives rise to constructive interference, which in turn gives rise to preferred directions for scattered photons. If these preferred directions are mapped on to a detector the result is positions on the detector where more photons are found - spots - and (ideally blank) regions between them - background:

The positions of the spots depends on the geometry of the experimental set up and the unit cell of the crystal. The _intensity_ of the spots is dependent on the intensity of the beam, the number of unit cells illuminated by the beam, any effects from sample absorption and - of greatest interest - the arrangement of atoms within the unit cell. In practice, it is the electrons which scatter (since the scattering cross section is ~ 2000x that of protons) so we are actually measuring the positions of electrons within the unit cell, which could look something like:

These are data taken from a very well ordered small molecule. The intensity measurement itself is related to the electron density within the unit cell as the squared modulus of the Fourier transform of the density: low angle reflections depend on the bulk arrangement of electrons and higher angle scattering results from finer detail. These give rise to a number of important facts:

- the experimental geometry is critical for correctly interpreting the diffraction data
- all atoms contribute to all intensities
- atom identification is inferred from the electron densities (in the absence of additional information)

The extent to which you can measure high resolution data depends largely on the overall internal order of the crystal. A very well ordered crystal will have a very high degree of correlation across multiple unit cells of atomic positions, thus ensuring that the construcive interference is measurable. In a less well ordered crystal this correlation can break down, reducing the capability for measuring the fine detail. There is a critical point where the number of data measured match the number of free parameters required to model that data - 0.84Ã…. If data at this resolution or higher are not observed then additional information will be needed to ensure that the refinement is well determined.
