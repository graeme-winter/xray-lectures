# Lectures in X-ray Diffraction

The elements of X-ray diffraction data analysis are often overlooked in the quest for "results" - the basics are however necessary to understand what to do when things go wrong or to interpret surprising results. The aim of these notes is to complement the usual set of talks I give on "how to collect data" and allow people to review or get more detail.

I make no apology for this having a certain amount of possibly inaccurate historical commentary: to me this is an important part of understanding the tooling we have now and the challenges we face in the future.

The structure of these notes is broken down into:

- [the elements of X-ray diffraction](./elements.md)
- [data collection strategies, geometry](./strategy.md)
- [measurement of diffracted X-rays](./detection.md)
- [contributions to signal and noise](./signal-noise.md)
- [context dependent advice on how to use the photons](./advice.md)
